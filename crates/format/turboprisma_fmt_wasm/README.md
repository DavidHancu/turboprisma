# @turboprisma/turboprisma-fmt-wasm

This directory only contains build logic to package the `turboprisma-fmt` engine
into a Node package as a WASM module. All the functionality is implemented in
other parts of Turboprisma.

The published NPM package is internal to Turboprisma. Its API will break without prior warning.

If you are looking for a stable, production-ready, developer SDK for Turboprisma, read [this](https://turboprisma.js.org/docs/sdk).
